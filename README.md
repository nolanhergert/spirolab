# spirolab
A fun visualization of sine waves in the phase space.

## Bug fixes soon
  * Sine waves are too loud when added together, cause lots of unnecessary clipping.

## Features soon
  * Better colors. I'm thinking green on dark background ðŸ™‚
  * Shift/Ctrl keep horizontal/vertical constant.
  * Enter amplitudes and frequencies manually.
  * Save links to fun ones and keep a running visualization of fun ones?
