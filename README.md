# spirolab
A fun visualization of the combination of sine wave audio in the phase space.

Also known as a spirograph. This is a lab for audio spirographs!

Old notes and ideas:

## Features
  * Can adjust frequency using the mouse
  * Visualization is fast and works!

## Bug fixes soon
  * Sine waves are too loud when added together, cause lots of unnecessary clipping.
  * Mouse position not accessible on Firefox?

## Features soon
  * Better colors. I'm thinking green on dark background ðŸ™‚
  * Touch support for phone.
  * Adjustable legends? Or just have map drop points and the legend is always frequency and amplitude?
  * Full screen-ish.
  * Hint dots for good frequency combinations
  * Shift/Ctrl keep horizontal/vertical constant.
  * Enter amplitudes and frequencies manually.
  * Save links to fun ones and keep a running visualization of fun ones?
  * Look at old notes to see what other ideas I had
