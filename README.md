# spirolab
A fun visualization of the combination of interactive sine wave audio frequencies in the phase space.

Also known as a spirograph or a lissajous figure, or a harmonograph. This is a lab for audio spirographs...spirolab :)

Old notes and ideas:
  * https://nolanhergert.github.io/notes_old/programming/spirolab.html
  * https://nolanhergert.github.io/notes_old/projects/spirolab.html

## Features
  * Can adjust two frequencies at a time using the mouse. Explore your own chords, harmonics, and combination / tartini tones! (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_tone)
  * Visualization is fast and works!

## Bug fixes soon
  * Sine waves are too loud when added together, cause lots of unnecessary clipping.
  * Mouse position not accessible on Firefox?

## Features soon
  * Touch support for phone.
  * Adjustable legends? Or just have map drop points and the legend is always frequency and amplitude?
  * Full screen-ish.
  * Hint dots for good frequency combinations
  * Keyboard shortcuts
    * Up/Down/Left/Right adjust in .1 hz increments? Can set probably
    * Shift/Ctrl keep horizontal/vertical constant.
    * Shift + Ctrl keeps angle from origin constant.
    * Spacebar freezes point on screen.
  * Enter amplitudes and frequencies manually. Amplitude can be negative...
  * Save links to fun ones and keep a running visualization of fun ones?
  * Look at old notes to see what other ideas I had
  * Have more frequencies be able to be added?
